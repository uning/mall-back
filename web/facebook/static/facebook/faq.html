<h1>NIGHTCLUB CITY FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
<br>
<h2>What's the purpose of the game?</h2>
<p>This is your opportunity to build the ultimate nightclub! Decorate the room, set the music, hire the people, pour the drinks, host the celebrities... clean up the messes! You're in control - do your thing, bring in the money, build it bigger and BETTER!</p>
<h2>How do I make money?</h2>
<p>Bring in guests and keep them there as long as you can! Collect a cover charge, pour the drinks (don't forget the tips), and book those VIP booths! But remember, to make money you've got to spend money... your guests are more likely to spend more money if they're diggin' your spot :)</p>
<h2>How do I hire employees?</h2>
<p>In the early levels you'll only have your DJ to bring the guests in. Soon enough you'll be able to hire a bartender to give the crowd another reason to stay. In a few more levels you can bring in a bouncer to keep the masses peaceful... or should you hire another bartender? It's all up to you!</p>
<h2>I ran out of drinks! What do I do?</h2>
<p>You can replenish your bar supplies by clicking on your Drink Supply Bar! Keep in mind that supplies cost money, so keep the drinks flowing and the music going! Alternatively, add neighbors to your club and have them drop by and replenish your bar supplies for you!</p>
<h2>The DJ stopped spinning music! What do I do?</h2>
<p>Sometimes the DJ has to take a break (or do they?). When you want to get the music pumping again, just Refresh the Set by clicking on the button that's just underneath your Level Progress Bar (it's marked with an image of a record). And keep an eye on the time that shows up: that will tell you when the current set will end. Don't forget, you can upgrade your turntable deck to enable your DJ to spin longer!</p>
<h2>How do I get a Celebrity into my club?</h2>
<p>When you start running your club, the stars don't yet know about your discreet little dive. But if the price is right, you can book them to make an appearance! More prestigious Celebrities will cost more to book, but they'll also make your other guests happier! After a few scheduled appearances, the Celebrities will turn into Regulars and frequent your hotspot on their own!</p>
<h2>I see different symbols above my club-goers heads. What do they mean?</h2>
<p>These are Status Indicators - they signal to you what your guests are doing and how they're feeling.</p>
<h2>How do I invite friends to join and play?</h2>
<p>Just click on the "Invite Friends" button at the bottom of your screen and invite your Facebook friends to join the scene!</p>
<h2>How do I visit another player's club?</h2>
<p>Once you've got some friends playing with you, you can click on their Avatar at the bottom of your game screen and visit their club to see how they run things (though we're sure you do it much better). You can be a pal and spin some tunes while they're gone or restock their bar as well!</p>
<h2>I want to see more of my club. How do I do that?</h2>
<p>As your club grows in size, you'll want to keep an eye on all corners to make sure everyone is having a great time. Use the zoom function found just below your Drink Supply Bar!</p>
<h2>I want more room for dancing and partying! How do I increase the space of my club?</h2>
<p>You can buy expansions and upgrade your club as your level increases. More furniture and decorations cost a pretty penny, so keep the club thriving and start saving that money!</p>
<h2>How do I purchase furniture and decorations?</h2>
<p>Click on the "Redecorate" icon (marked by a pail of purple paint) and select any one of the categories to purchase some furnishings for your club. Some items are only available after you've reached a certain level, so keep slingin' those drinks and spinnin' those records!</p>
